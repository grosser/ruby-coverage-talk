  - slow: do not always run in tests

  # Line Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/coverage_line.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage' # -> coverage.so
  Coverage.start     # enable for newly loaded code
  require_relative 'example'
  example
  Coverage.result    # disable

  {"example.rb"=>[1, 1, 0, nil, 1, nil, nil]}
  ```

  ???

  - simplest form
  - .result has side-effect of disabling, can use peek_result
  - 0/1 = hit count
  - nil = not code (end/else/comment etc)

  ---

  # Line Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/example.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  {"example.rb"=>[1, 1, 0, nil, 1, nil, nil]}

  def example             # 1 - Covered, loaded not ran
    if 1 == 2             # 1 - Covered, ran once
      "a"                 # 0 - Not-Covered
    else                  # nil
      3 == 2 ? "b" : "c"  # 1 - Covered, ran once
    end                   # nil
  end                     # nil
  ```

  ???

  - we hit example and the second branch
  - problem: in else the 3==2 has 2 outcomes, "b" never reached ... should rewrite as *next slide*

  ---

  # Line Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/example_expanded.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  {"example.rb"=>[1, 1, 0, nil, 1, 0, nil, 1, nil, nil, nil]}
                                =================
  ...
      if 3 == 2           # 1 - Covered
        "b"               # 0 - Not Covered
      else                # nil
        "c"               # 1 - Covered
      end                 # nil
  ...
  ```

  ???

  - enforce via rubocop ?
  - use branch coverage! 2.5+

  ---

  # Branch Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/coverage_branch.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage'
  Coverage.start branches: true # Ruby 2.5+
  require_relative 'example'
  example
  Coverage.result
  ```

  ???

  - easy right ? *next slide* NO!

  ---

  # Branch Coverage

  ```Ruby
  "example.rb"=>{:branches=>{
    # type, id, start line, start char, end line, end char
    [:if, 0, 5, 4, 5, 22]=>{
      [:then, 1, 5, 13, 5, 16]=>0,
      [:else, 2, 5, 19, 5, 22]=>1
    },
    [:if, 3, 2, 2, 6, 5]=>{
      [:then, 4, 3, 4, 3, 7]=>0,
      [:else, 5, 5, 4, 5, 22]=>1
    }
  ```

  ???

  - big hash where keys are the branches
  - ignore branches + first 2 items are kind+index
  - only care for last 4 items
  - ... look back at code

  ---

  # Branch Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/example.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  # char 4-22 = Y | char 13-16 = N | char 19-22 = Y

  def example
    if 1 == 2
      "a"
    else
      3 == 2 ? "b" : "c"
      YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
               NNN   YYY
    end
  end
  ```

  ???

  - enough info for simple tooling
  - does not detect ||= / optional params
  - slower than line
  - for prod to find dead code prefer oneshot

  ---

  # Oneshot Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/coverage_oneshot.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage'
  Coverage.start oneshot_lines: true # Ruby 2.6+
  require_relative 'example'
  5.times { example }
  Coverage.result
  {"example.rb"=>{:oneshot_lines=>[1, 2, 5]}}
  ```

  ???

  - fast: removed after execution
  - no oneshot_branches

  ---

  # Oneshot Coverage

  <!-- see 01-Internals/example.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  # {"example.rb"=>{:oneshot_lines=>[1, 2, 5]}}
  def example             # Covered
    if 1 == 2             # Covered
      "a"                 # ?
    else                  # ?
      3 == 2 ? "b" : "c"  # Covered
    end                   # ?
  end                     # ?
  ```

  ???

  - bad for automation, does not show uncovered/uncoverable<br/>
  need ruby parser to know what is uncoverable

  # 🔄 Recap

  - `Coverage.start` = simple lines
  - `Coverage.start branches: true` = weird but useful
  - `Coverage.start oneshot_lines: true` = fast but hard to use

  # Actionable Coverage

  - Mindset
  - Problems
  - Solution
  - Migration

  ---

  # Mindset

  - Not a metric, easy to cheat on

  ???

  - use `||` instead of if
  - only unit test

  ---

  # Mindset

  - Not a metric, easy to cheat on
  - 100% coverage != good test

  ???

  - 100% = no stupid errors
  - not no logical errors
  - Covered != tested

  ---

  # Mindset

  - Not a metric, easy to cheat on
  - 100% coverage != good test
  - A helper/fallback: <br/>
  "Did you write a test for that ?"<br/>
  "Why does it rescue ?"<br/>
  "What happens when xyz ?"

  ???

  - often thought I had coverage but never covered edge case
  - edge case was unreachable

  ---

  # Problems

  - Slow feedback

  ???

  - have to make PR and wait for hook, run all tests, open browser
  - adds frustration / not actionable

  ---

  # Problems

  - Slow feedback
  - Impossible to reach 100% coverage

  ???

  - setup code and edge-cases
  - broken window effect

  ---

    # Problems

  - Slow feedback
  - Impossible to reach 100% coverage
  - Bikeshedding about what % is ok

  ???

  - 100% cannot be reached so we guess
  - rewrite a statement to be readable and suddenly it's not covered

  ---

    # Problems

  - Slow feedback
  - Impossible to reach 100% coverage
  - Bikeshedding about what % is ok
  - Complicated setup

  ???

  - install webhooks
  - pay providers
  - get accounts for contributors
  - error? -> irreproducible locally

  ---

  # Solution

  ???

  - the solution we need is ...

  ---

  # Solution

  - quick, atomic development feedback

  ???

  - run a single file, matches a single test, small runtime overhead, exact location, console output
  - easy to contribute when tests are easy to find
  - encourage seeking quick local feedback instead of taking a break after PRs
  - bad PRs still fail but can be reproduced

  ---

  # Solution

  - quick, atomic development feedback
  - mark intentional gaps to get 100%

  ???

  - call out gaps explicitly, raise awareness when editing code, 100% avoid broken windows

  ---

  # Solution

  - quick, atomic development feedback
  - mark intentional gaps to get 100%
  - branch coverage

  ---

  # Solution

  - quick, atomic development feedback
  - mark intentional gaps to get 100%
  - branch coverage
  - piecemeal migration approach

  ???

  cannot stop the world, need a place to start .. single file or static state

  ---

  # Solution

  - quick, atomic development feedback
  - mark intentional gaps to get 100%
  - branch coverage
  - piecemeal migration approach
  - simple/local/free setup

  ???

  who wants a complicated, remote, paid setup ?

  # SingleCov

  Missing coverage on every 💚 run

  ```Bash
  rspec spec/foobar_spec.rb
  ......
  114 example, 0 failures

  lib/foobar.rb new uncovered lines introduced (2 current vs 0 configured)",
  Uncovered lines:
  lib/foobar.rb:22:10-22:14
  lib/foobar.rb:23
  ```

  ???

  - minitest + rspec
  - catch coverage issues before making PRs
  - makes PRs fail when coverage is missing
  - calls out exact location
  - configure allowed gaps

  ---

  # SingleCov

  - 2-5% runtime overhead on single files, compared to 10-20% for SimpleCov
  - Branch coverage on ruby 2.5+ (disable via branches: false)
  - Use with `forking_test_runner` for per test coverage

  ---

  # SingleCov

  Start with a single test, no side-effects

  ```Ruby
  # test/foo_test.rb
  SingleCov.covered!
  ```

  ???

  - your work area/feature
  - security features
  - piecemeal onboarding

  ---

  # SingleCov

  Stop coverage degradation: bootstrap script

  ```Ruby
  ... bootstrap spec/**/*_spec.rbb

  SingleCov.covered! uncovered: 42
  ```

  ???

  - stops newly uncovered code and allows slowly working through backlog

  ---

  # SingleCov

  Inline comments

  ```Ruby
  SingleCov.covered! uncovered: 1
  ==
  SingleCov.covered!

  if this_can_never_happen
    raise # uncovered
  end
  ```

  ---

  # SingleCov

  ```Ruby
  SingleCov.assert_used   # all tests have coverage

  SingleCov.assert_tested # all files have tests

  # SingleCov Demo

  ???

  - No real demo because I'm scared
  - Randomly picked project and file, not cherry-picked because it's bad
  - Not trying to pick on maintainers, just making a point
  - you think your tests are good, they are not
  - Same is seen all over ruby land ... some accepted PRs

  ---

  # SingleCov Demo

  - clone `https://github.com/rails/rails`

      @key_access.clear
      @cache_size = 0
    end

  ???

  - We should have tests for this right ??
  - Synchronize should have some test ?

  ---

  # SingleCov Demo

  Don't boot up for each test

  - Avoid pollution + capture per file coverage

  ???

  - Unit tests check coverage in isolation
  - addition integration tests ok

  ---

  # Hack forked coverage

  Forking resets coverage

  <!-- see 03-forked/forked_reset.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage'
  Coverage.start
  require_relative 'example'
  example
  fork { puts Coverage.result }
  {"example.rb"=>[0, 0, 0, nil, 0, nil, nil]}
  ```

  ???

  Makes full coverage unreachable since requires cannot be redone

  ---

  # Hack forked coverage


  <!-- see 03-forked/combine_in_fork.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  # ... load everything
  peek = Coverage.peek_result
  fork do
    # ... test
    result = Coverage.result.map do |file, cov|
      cov.each_with_index.map do |c, i|
        peek[file][i] ? peek[file][i] + c : c
      end
    end
  end
  {"example.rb"=>[1, 2, 1, nil, 1, nil, nil]}

  ???

  Store prefork, test, add

  ---

  # Hack forked coverage

  ```Bash
  forking-test-runner test/ --merge-coverage
  ```

  ???

  - under the hood of forking-test-runner
  - integrates well with single_cov and makes CI coverage same as local (often more because it runs all tests)

  ---

  # Hack forked coverage

  ```Bash
  forking-test-runner test/ --merge-coverage
  ```

  - handles branch coverage / edge-cases
  - preloads AR fixtures / helpers etc

  ???

  - maybe in the future oneshot

  ---

  # Combine in parent

  fork & combine coverage

  <!-- see 03-forked/combine_in_parent.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  # ... load everything
  read, write = IO.pipe
  Process.wait(fork do
    # ... test
    Marshal.dump(Coverage.result, write)
  end)
  result = Coverage.result + Marshal.load(read)
  {"example.rb"=>[1, 2, 1, nil, 1, nil, nil]}

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Oneshot usable for coverage calculations

  <!-- see 04-wishlist/onheshot.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage'
  Coverage.start oneshot_lines: :boolean
  require_relative 'example'
  example 1
  Coverage.result
  {"example.rb"=>{:oneshot_lines=>[true, false, nil, true]}}
  ```

  ???

  Could simply grep false and report on that

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Oneshot branches

  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage'
  Coverage.start oneshot_branches: true
  require_relative 'example'
  example 1
  Coverage.result
  {"example.rb"=>{:oneshot_branches=>{ .. branches ... }}}
  ```

  ???

  - production coverage (low overhead + peek_result endpoint)
  - combine all servers for coverage map

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Inherit coverage in forks

  <!-- see 04-wishlist/adding.rb -->
  ```Ruby
  require 'coverage'
  Coverage.start inherit_on_fork: true
  require_relative 'example'
  example 1
  fork do
    example 2
    Coverage.result
  end
  ```

  ???

  avoid merge logic for branch/oneshot

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Coverage for default parameters

  ```Ruby
  def foo(a = default)
    puts a
  end
  ```

  a was passed in <-> a was not passed in

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Coverage for logical operators

  ```Ruby
  # covered
  success || raise("Ooops")

  # not covered
  raise("Ooops") unless success
  ```

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Path coverage

  ```Ruby
  a = a ? : 1 : 2
  a = a ? : 3 : 4
  ```

  4 Paths through this code
  1/3 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 2/4

  ???

  super annoying to get 100% coverage but could be interesting for security/complicated things

  ---

  # Coverage Wishlist

  Turn on for loaded code -> per request/controller coverage

  ```Ruby
  Coverage.start add_to_existing: true
  ```

  ---

  # 🔄 Recap

  - automatable oneshot
  - oneshot branches
  - inherit coverage on fork
  - default params coverage
  - logical operators coverage
  - path coverage
